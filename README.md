### Description


"Epic collection, friend. Your library is all filled up. To save more, you'll need to remove some songs" - Spotify

Spotify limits the number of songs you can "Save" to your account to 10,000. This has affected a small, but <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Live-Ideas/Your-Music-Increase-maximum-Songs-allowed-in-Your-Music/idi-p/733759/page/50#comments">vocal</a> portion of users who enjoy collecting and saving records in their accounts. 

In The Wav is a single page web application built using the Spotify API, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails. It is meant to give collectors a single, convenient location to continue to collect their Spotify albums and easily listen to them with Spotify's in-browser player.

1. Fork and Clone
2. `bundle install`
3. `rake db:migrate`
2. Boot up a Local Rails Server (ie `Rails s -p 5212`)
